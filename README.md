 Key bot to automoate movements for various tasks on a Shaiya server.
 1. no-afk.exe v1.0
     1. Bot to prevent EG Shaiya from marking a player as away from keyboard.
     2. To use, apply a reusable skill to the 1 keybind that is non-castable, non-targatable, and has a recharge of less than 2 minutes.
     3. This bot may require that the user run Shaiya in a virtual machine, since Shaiya has a tendency to eat inputs from bots.
     4. This bot definetely requires that the user's sit/stand keybind is set to default (the 'c' button). 
     5. This bot also requires users to have their Shaiya window active at all times of operation.
     6. Any deviation from the prior instructions could cause the bot to malfunction.
