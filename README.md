   b. To use, apply a reusable skill to the 1 keybind that is non-castable, non-targatable, and has a recharge of less than 2 minutes.
   c. This bot may require that the user run Shaiya in a virtual machine, since Shaiya has a tendency to eat inputs from bots.
   d. This bot definetely requires that the user's sit/stand keybind is set to default (the 'c' button). 
   e. This bot also requires users to have their Shaiya window active at all times of operation.
